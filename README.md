# Project 1: Microsoft Movie Studio
## Microsoft Film Industry Analysis
This is the first project in the Flatiron Data Science


This project focuses on Microsoft's venturing into the movie/film industry and aims to provide data-driven 
insights to identify the best genre, runtime, and director for their upcoming movie. 
As a potential junior data analyst, we have conducted an in-depth analysis using the data provided to make informed recommendations.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to determine the optimal genre for Microsoft's entry into the film industry. By analyzing the given datasets, 
we have identified the genre that aligns with the the most profitable with audiences and offers the highest potential for success. 
Additionally, we have explored the relationship between genre and runtime to find the ideal film length for this genre. 
Lastly, we have examined various directors' track records to pinpoint the best-suited director for the chosen genre.


## Data Analysis
Using advanced data analysis techniques, I have performed the following tasks:

1. Genre Analysis: Through comprehensive analysis using SQL and Pandas of the dataset, we have evaluated the performance and popularity 
of different film genres. By considering factors such as box office revenue, and audience ratings, 
we have identified the genre that presents the most promising opportunity for Microsoft's film endeavors.

2. Runtime Optimization: By examining the relationship between genre and film runtime, we have determined the 
optimal length for the selected genre. This analysis accounts for audience preferences and the amount of money that was generated from said film. 
As well as industry standards to ensure the film's runtime maximizes engagement.

3. Director Selection: We have delved into the dataset to evaluate the past work and achievements of various directors. 
By considering factors such as box office success, genre compatibility, and runtime we have identified the most suitable director 
to helm the chosen genre for Microsoft's film.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis conducted, I recommend the following:

Genre: Animation - This genre has demonstrated significant success, aligns with the target audience, 
and presents substantial growth potential for Microsoft's entry into the film industry.

Runtime: 90 Minutes -  This runtime offers the optimal balance between storytelling, audience engagement for the chosen genre 
and box office success, ensuring a compelling film experience .

Director: Chris Buck -  With a proven track record in directing successful films within the recommended genre, 
this director possesses the necessary expertise to bring Microsoft's film vision to life.


## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the best genre, runtime, and director for Microsoft's campaign into the film industry. 
By leveraging data-driven analysis, we aim to help Microsoft make informed decisions that maximize their chances of success in this competitive industry.
